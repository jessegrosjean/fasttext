let text = "CHAPTER 1. 👨🏽‍✈️ Loomings.\n\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—havinglittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest meon shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery partof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen andregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim aboutthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; wheneverI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, andbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenevermy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moralprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, andmethodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time toget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; Iquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If theybut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round bywharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with hersurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extremedowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, andcooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight ofland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from CorlearsHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. Whatdo you see?—Posted Lorem ipsum dolor sit חקדדקןדיקרק ほwっおんぐぃっぃtyぺあんdうぁとぃっぃげっ like silent sentinels all around the town, standthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Someleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; somelooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in therigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But theseare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied tocounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Arethe green fields gone? What do they here?\n\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, andseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but theextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonderwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the wateras they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles ofthem—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streetsand avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tellme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of allthose ships attract them thither?\n\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Takealmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in adale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic init. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepestreveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he willinfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try thisexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysicalprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded forever.\n\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valleyof the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand histrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix werewithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and upfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlandswinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed intheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, andthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon thisshepherd’s hחקדדקןדיקרקead, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye werefixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep amongTiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a dropof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travelyour thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, uponsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buyhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestriantrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with arobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such amystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now outof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why didthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surelyall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of thatstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mildimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But thatsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the imageof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I beginto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of mylungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as apassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and apurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengersget sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoythemselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as aCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinctionof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate allhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kindwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable gloryin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, Inever fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciouslybuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one whowill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiledfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the oldEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see themummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,plumb down into the forecasחקדדקןדיקרקtle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar tospar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort ofthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, theVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, ifjust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have beenlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand inawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from aschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca andthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears offin time.\n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broomand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangelGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly andrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’ta slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains mayorder me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have thesatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else isone way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical ormetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump ispassed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,and be content.\n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point ofpaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a singlepenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves mustpay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying andbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortableinfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _beingpaid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a manreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestlybelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on noaccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consignourselחקדדקןדיקרקves to perdition!\n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesomeexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, ifyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part theCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand fromthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but notso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in manyother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. Butwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as amerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whalingvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has theconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me insome unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grandprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came inas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensiveperformances. I take it that this part of the bill must have runsomething like this:\n\n“_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”\n\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, theFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, whenothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and shortand easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though Icannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all thecircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motiveswhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, inducedme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into tחקדדקןדיקרקhedelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewilland discriminating judgment.\n\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whalehimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all mycuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his islandbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with allthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such thingswould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with aneverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, andland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick toperceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they letme—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates ofthe place one lodges in.\n\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; thegreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wildconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated intomy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of themall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\n\nCHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\n\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under myarm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good cityof old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday nightin December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the littlepacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reachingthat place would offer, till the following Monday.\n\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop atthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as wellbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind wasmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was afine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famousold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford hasof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, anחקדןדיקרקd thoughin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucketwas her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where thefirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucketdid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoesto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, didthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden withimported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, inorder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from thebowsprit?\n\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before mein New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became amatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was avery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly coldand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I hadsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle ofa dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards thenorth with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom youmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure toinquire the price, and don’t be too particular.\n\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “TheCrossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Furtheron, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there camesuch fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow andice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost layten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because fromhard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a mostmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing onemoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds ofthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’tyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots arestopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streetsthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if notthe cheeriest inns.\n\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. Atthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter ofthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky lightproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stoodinvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for theuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumbleover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flyingparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, thenmust needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up andhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interiordoor.\n\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred blackfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel ofDoom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and thepreacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weepingand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backingout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’\n\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from thedocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw aswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintlyrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these wordsunderneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\n\nCoffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thoughtI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose thisPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, andthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidatedlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted herefrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had apoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the veryspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\n\nIt was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsiedas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling thanever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on thehob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous windcalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess theonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thoulookest out at it from a glass window wheחקדדקיקרקre the frost is all on theoutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, wherethe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the onlyglazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to mymind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes arewindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’tstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little linthere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. Theuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were cartedoff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teethagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters withhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put acorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out thetempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silkenwrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frostynight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of theiroriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me theprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\n\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them upto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatrathan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along theline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, inorder to keep out this frost?\n\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before thedoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should bemoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like aCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of atemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\n\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and thereis plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frostedfeet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.\n\n"
